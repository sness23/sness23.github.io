cyberpunk is definitely back
that is so lovely
all my old cyberpunk things
from the mid 1990s
we can retrieve again
and make new
i should have a blog that is
comprehensible as well
but this is just a stream
of consciousness blog
like i've been doing for
a long time now
it's my kind of poetry
i suppose

i've been reading my old blogs
and it is so nice to read what
i wrote before.  it reminds me
of how hardcore i was and should
continue to be.
