brings back memories

listening to CBC Victoria
in the morning

doing some thinking
but also doing some listening

this is nice
i can write it like poetry
and then it comes out
like a real sentence.

now i just need an AI to take
my randomness and turn it into
something that different
individuals could understand
and that talks to them in a way
they understand

it's an extension of how
templating libraries like
these work

spinning stories
some of them true

some of it is true
and some is
obviously not true

some nights,
playing music was like a job
and that was a bad feeling

stream of conciousness
that was a thing

</pre>

Trying to find some way to be inspired and motivated
but not get burnt out.  A way to build projects and have
fun (and have funds) and do it in a way i can look back
at it later and learn from my current self.

<pre>
listening to thesushidragon stream tonight
maybe this would be a good way of capturing notes
for my ethnography
