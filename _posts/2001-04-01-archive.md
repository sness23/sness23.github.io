### Busy day, even though it's

Busy day, even though it's the weekend, getting stuff *done*. <br /> Reinstalled
Windows 2000 on Vayu, made yummy omlettes with bacon, went and bought the new
Sheila Chandra, This Sentence is True, loaded up on Escents soaps (Tea Tree
mostly, but also Mint Eucalyptus and Siam Spice), had coffee with Melissa, made
a huge pot of chili and installed a whole bunch of software on Vayu.  Listening
to Sheila Chandra now, it is very awesome.

Yay!  <a href="http://www.sness.net/hack/dddgraph7.ps">It</a> compiles and
doesn't segfault!  Now, tomorrow, check the output and make the data<br />
structure more funky so that it resembles real contig/clone data.  Wow, that was
a one to fit the<br /> brain around, let me tell YOU!  :)

### Wow, had an intense holiday.

Wow, had an intense holiday.  I'm almost always more tired at the end of the
holiday than the beginning, I always do a lot of internal work, and it's tiring.
If you want to hear what I did, you'll have<br /> to wait for the short book
entitled <b>My Holydays <i>or</i> Deep in the belly, in the belly of the
earth</b>.

### Referencing the last post, I

Referencing the last post, I don't know why I got a deja-vu from that code
window, I don't think I've seen anything like that before, it's just a sness
occurrence.  Like all things sness, hard to quantify, and even harder to wrap
your head around.  Ah sness.  :)
