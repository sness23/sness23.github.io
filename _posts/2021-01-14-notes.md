# emacs lisp

i have an insert-date function
that i bind to `M-i`, i found
it somewhere on the web

```
(defun insert-date ()
  "Insert date at the current cursor position in the current buffer."
  (interactive)
  (insert  
   (format-time-string "# %b%d%y %H:%M%n")
   ))
```

format-time-string has a ton of options, but
a three-letter month that is lower-case does not
appear to be one yet.

to do this, i wrapped the existing `format-time-string` function
with the downcase function in emacs lisp

```
(defun insert-date ()
  "Insert date at the current cursor position in the current buffer."
  (interactive)
  (insert  
   (downcase (format-time-string "# %b%d%y %H:%M%n"))
   ))
```

this is one of the real benefits to having a system
that is written in a language that you can use

even better though would be if emacs had an API and
i could use whatever language i wanted to control it

same thing with pymol

# ubuntu alacritty copy paste with keyboard

[Okay, so how to paste text in the Linux Terminal?](https://www.fosslinux.com/14088/how-to-copy-and-paste-commands-in-linux-terminal.htm)

> Due to the above-discussed issue, the modern Terminal developers applied Ctrl + Shift + V for paste. Similarly Ctrl + Shift + C for copy function. Alternatively, you can right-click and select paste from the menu for pasting the copied command-line.
