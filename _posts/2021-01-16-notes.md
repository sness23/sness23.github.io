# genx art

[nxnw][nxnw_fb] : artist [marlo shaw][marlo]

> ... i really respect david hockney and his generation ... more optimistic about the future ... everything will work out ok ... but genx is much more apprehensive ... climate change ... our planet in general ... not sure if painting will change anything ... reflection on what gives me pause or fills me with horror, not sure if it will change the world, art is funny that way ...

```
that's so interesting
about how art both reflects the world
and also changes it
```
