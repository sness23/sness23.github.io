# API

In A standard set of APIs are generated from an IDL.  we should support the event
based architecture first, but also REST, gRPC and GraphQL.

it might sound like a good idea to just support one kind of API, but there are
usually some reasons why people want a different API.  That is fine, the exact
kind of API doesn't matter, what matters is that we can all work together.

these kind of contracts could also be seen as a kind of [RFC].

> the documents "shape the Internet's inner workings and have played a significant role in its success", but are not well known outside the community.

these IDLs are the contracts between services and are published globally.

these should generate tests that can be run against the services to verify they
are living up to the contract.

they can also generate code for the service to start with, but this is optional.
