### The healing meditation on the

The <a href="http://www.babaji.net">healing meditation</a> on the 25th (full
moon) was really sweet energy.  Very gentle and wonderful.  Had a sense of
Babaji being there, as well as feeling the other people meditating, and feeling
the thoughts of the people in my building.  I had an image of everyone
meditating at once in every apartment, golden chakras.

### Emotions, so many dancing chemicals.

Emotions, so many dancing chemicals.  Just breathe through the emotions, when
they come up, <br /> don't let them create new karma in the body, just let them
go.  Emotion with flow, flow.

### Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequencedAs reported

<h2>Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequenced</h2><br>As <a
href="http://www.nature.com/nature/links/001214/001214-1.html">reported</a> in
the journal <a href="http://www.nature.com">Nature</a>, the entire genome of
Arabidopsis thaliana has just been <a
href="http://http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v408/n6814/full/408791a0_fs.html"><br>sequenced</a>.
A. thaliana is a model organism, and was earlier mapped by <br><a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=10391215&dopt=Abstract">Marra,
et al. </a>.  This is a huge advance for bioinformatics, and represents the
first plant genome to be<br>fully sequenced.

### Genome of Fugu may hold

<h2>Genome of Fugu may hold clues to Human Genome</h2><br><a
href="http://www.udel.edu/chem/white/teaching/CHEM647/CSP1Fugu.html">Fugu</a>
the poisonous fish prized by sushi enthusiasts, has a very <a
href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/12/11/MN134713.DTL"><br>small
genome</a>. Scientists now are planning to <a
href="http://fugu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/fugu/pffp/pf.html">sequence the entire fugu
genome</a> and <br>compare the Human and Fugu genomes, in order to find genes.

### New genetic research (on Drosophilia)

New <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/15/science/15AGIN.html">genetic
research</a> (on Drosophilia) to show that restricting caloric intake can <a
href="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/ardelt/Aging/Team8.htm">increase life
span</a>. This has been <a
href="http://www.sciam.com/2000/0600aging/0600taubes.html">shown</a> before in
other organisms, but this is the first time that a <a
href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2000/1214/1">genetic
mutation</a> has been able to significantly increase life span.  <br>Going
further out, there are <a

and breatharians</a> who live on cosmic energy alone.
