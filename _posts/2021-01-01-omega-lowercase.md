# folding.ai

I launched [folding.ai](https://www.folding.ai/) a couple weeks ago.  I was

things take a little time to develop.

# orchive v4

Launched [orchive.net](http://orchive.net) again, looks like
[orchive.cs.uvic.ca](http://orchive.cs.uvic.ca) will be going offline January
4th.  I'm busy uploading the mp3s to s3 for the launch.
