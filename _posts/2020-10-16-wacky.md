# sometimes google

google just told me "you can ask me what is coming up by asking whats in my day"

then i asked her "whats in my day"

and she said "i cant access your gsuite calendar but i'm learning to do new
things everyday."

that was confusing to me

# hmm

what should i work on this weekend?

i like this kind of stealth blog

it would be nice to have some tracking
i wonder how you do that with jekyll
