### One of the wonderful things

One of the wonderful things about having a shaved head: Not having to worry
about falling alseep with gum in your mouth, no hair for it to get tangled up
in!  (And yes, I did suffer this trauma once, and after an hour of painful
brushing to try to remove it, had to snip some hair off to get it out, yuck!).

### Hey! I've figured it out!

Hey!  I've figured it out!  <b>BOTH!</b>  :)

### Oh, decisions, decisions! Which one,

Oh, decisions, decisions!  Which one, the <a

the <a href="http://www.ita.sel.sony.com/jump/c1x/">Sony VAIO Transmeta
Picturebook</a>.  Hmmm, now I just need a few extra thousand dollars to burn. :)

Wow! Lesa with shaved head<br />
Flashing eyes, Kali, Shiva    <br />
Tremble in fear, Men.

Shave your head, Wheat,<br />
A nice and chilly wind<br />
makes your head feel neat.

Tonight, a full moon,<br />

### Got a new soundcard and

Got a new <a href="http://www.soundblaster.com">soundcard</a> and <a
href="http://www.radioshack.com">microphone</a> this weekend for my newly
refreshed linux box, I've been meaning to get some audio applications and hard
disk recording going on this box for some time, but since it was my main mail
and web server, I was a bit nervous.  Now that my netwinder is bravely taking
over these tasks, I'm more adventurous.  Got a midi cable as well, because I
*have* to get my Roland SPD-11 hooked up to my computer.  Now, that will
<b>rock</b>.

### Beautiful sounds in the radio

Beautiful <a href="http://www.sness.net/files/rpws_010104.wav">sounds</a> in the
radio waves near<br /> Jupiter.  Found by the <a
href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/acoustic/">Cassini</a> spacecraft.  Sounds
like ambient techno.  Now, that's what we need, streaming audio from all around
the solar system.  (hmm, as I write this, doesn't 'solar system' sound a bit
70's?  Do we need a new term?)

### Ohhhh, such a sweet setup

Ohhhh, such a sweet setup here at home now... 4 computers on the hub, my
firewall (cr1008674-a), the netwinder (durga), the windows box (vayu), and
shakti.  Mmmmm.  This rocks.  It's creating it's own little reality distortion
field here...
