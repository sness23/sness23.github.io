### Taught my first Yoga class

Taught my first Yoga class tonight!
I taught a group of 16-18 year olds, it was about an hour long
class, I showed them the Sun Salutation, twists and a lot of
breathing.  Wow, it was very cool.

both maximum<br /> extents of marks, as well as the consensus region.  Little
colored boxes identify the different <br /> markers and are matched with the

### Shiva level in Nethack A

<h3>Shiva level in Nethack</h3>

A portal is generated at around level 10-15 that takes you to the Shiva level.
There are 4 levels,<br /> 3 are big rooms, but completely filled with really
nasty monsters that don't leave any items.  First level is elementals, second is
golems, third is demons.  Here's the trick, if you have been a pacifist, all
these monsters will instead be figurines of these monsters.  The fourth level is
empty, except for a throne in the middle of the room.  Around the throne are an
amulet of life saving, a bag of holding,and two blessed figurines of a Archons,
Ida and Pingala.

If you have been a pacifist, Shiva is seated in the middle of the room in
meditation, and will give you the "Mantle of Shiva", which you can wear for huge
AC, protection from fire, cold, level<br /> drain and shocking.  You can apply
it in a direction and all monsters in that direction will be <br /> turned into
figurines.  You can invoke it, when invoked it summons another high level pet.

### Shiva!

### Hee hee, check this out:

Hee hee, check this out:

<listing>//<br />
// Enumerated Mountain Rule<br />
//

struct PathList;

// One item in a path<br />
struct PathItem {<br />
  int indx; // Index into clones[]<br />
  struct PathItem *next;  // Next PathItem in the list

  struct PathList *links;<br />
};

// One path<br />
struct PathList {<br />
  struct PathItem *head;<br />
  struct PathItem *z;<br />
};

// All the paths<br />
struct PathCollection {<br />
  struct PathList *head;<br />
  struct PathList *z;<br />
};

</listing>

Hee hee!  Lots of recursive data structures here!  Isn't the PathList in
PathItem a cute multi-dimensional treat?

### Man, I love coding little

Man, I love coding little cute algorithms, I love thinking about the most
efficient way to implement algorithms, weird little data structures..  Cool. I
find in C that I stick with simpler data structures like arrays, not like how I
used to work in C++, but then there is more to keep track of in C, which makes
it fun and challenging.


### Interesting day today, got a

Interesting day today, got a great start on the Enumerated Mountain Rule, wrote this cute little bit of code:<br />
<listing>

int compare_sulstons(const void* a, const void* b)<br />
{

  if((*(struct MatrixListItem**)a)->score < (*(struct MatrixListItem**)b)->score) return -1;<br />
  if((*(struct MatrixListItem**)a)->score > (*(struct MatrixListItem**)b)->score) return 1;<br />
  return 0;<br />
}<br />
int build_bestlist(struct Clone **clones, struct Contig **contigs, int ctgnum, int tolerance)<br />
{<br />
  int i, j, k;<br />
  int num, tot;

  // 1) Allocate memory for list and clear list<br />
  num = contigs[ctgnum]->num_show;<br />
  tot = num * (num - 1) / 2;<br />
  bestlist = (struct MatrixListItem **) malloc (sizeof (struct MatrixListItem*) * tot);

  for (i = 0; i < tot; i++) {<br />
	bestlist[i] = (struct MatrixListItem *) malloc (sizeof (struct MatrixListItem));<br />
	bestlist[i]->indx1 = -1;<br />
	bestlist[i]->indx2 = -1;<br />
	bestlist[i]->score = 0.0;<br />
  }

  // 2) Build the list (half the matrix)<br />
  k = 0;<br />
  for (i = 0; i < num; i++)<br />
	for (j = i+1; j < num; j++) {<br />
	  bestlist[k]->indx1 = contigs[ctgnum]->show_indx[i];<br />
	  bestlist[k]->indx2 = contigs[ctgnum]->show_indx[j];<br />
	  bestlist[k]->score = sulston(clones[contigs[ctgnum]->show_indx[i]],clones[contigs[ctgnum]->show_indx[j]]);<br />
	  if (DEBUG >= 2)<br />
		printf("Adding %3i %3i %3i\t\t1=%3i\t2=%3i\t%.1e\n",i,j,k,bestlist[k]->indx1,bestlist[k]->indx2,bestlist[k]->score);<br />
	  k++;<br />
	}

  // 3) Sort this list by sulston score<br />
  qsort(bestlist, tot, sizeof(struct MatrixListItem*), compare_sulstons);<br />
  <br />
  // 4) Print the list out<br />
  if (DEBUG)<br />
	for (i = 0; i < tot; i++) {<br />
	  printf("Score = %.1e\ti = %i\tClone A %3i (%s)\tClone B %3i (%s)\n",bestlist[i]->score,i,<br />
			 bestlist[i]->indx1, clones[bestlist[i]->indx1]->clonename,<br />
			 bestlist[i]->indx2, clones[bestlist[i]->indx2]->clonename);<br />
	}

<br />
  return tot;

<br />
}<br />

Isn't that cute?  :)

### Wow! More fun work today!

Wow!  More fun work today!  Pulled out all the code from ,<b>gactg</b> and put
it into <i>ga.c</i> and <i>ga.h</i>, then made gactg just call these routines to
do it's work.  Then, used <i>ga.[ch]</i> to add gactg functionality to
<b>contiger</b>!  So, now you can look at your contigs, and interactively run<br
/> genetic algorithms on them to fix them up.  Hopefully will put this right
into <b>FPC</b> which would rock, but might be difficult.  I'll get it going in
contiger first, then go crazy after that.

### Wow, had an *incredible* week!

Wow, had an *incredible* week!  Wrote over 1500 lines of code, got a <br />
full GA up and running that looks very promising for doing our contig<br />
ordering!  

This takes 15 seconds to run at home (600 MHz Pentium III) for 10000 <br />
generations.  Order is perfect, except that 8 should be at the leftmost   <br />
end.

Scores are all the sulston exponents between each neighbour and the next.<br />
This tries to minimize that quantity.  It's very fast.

Cool, eh!

promise.
