<p><a href="http://www.captaintractor.com">Captain Tractor</a> rocks.  Sadly, they don't have an MP3 for their best song (IMHO) The Last Saskatchewan Pirate.  I didn't know until recently that the Arrogant Worms wrote that song.  Interesting.</p>

<p>Imagine being on a planet without rain, there would be no trees, no grass, no flowers.  Most planets don't have rain, it's a miracle of the planet earth.  Rain is beautiful!</p>

<h3 class="title">Babaji Full Moon meditation this</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.babaji.net">Babaji</a> Full Moon meditation this morning at 5am.  Very gentle and energetic.  Had an incredible dream before the meditation, I was in the back seat of a car, my friend went inside a building, left the car's engine running, but parked.  The car started driving itself in front of the building, first just moving a little bit backwards and forwards, then in circles.  The car was so tiny that I couldn't get over the front seat to push the break, I was stretching but couldn't make it.  A female cop was outside, pointing her gun at the car and being very excited generally.  It was very hilarious!  We got the car stopped finally, I think it just stopped by itself.  Then, they took me back to my friends place, I shook the hand of the male cop, but the female cop went upstairs before I could shake her hand, so I waited downstairs.  She didn't come down, so I just sat at a table, and talked to a very intense young woman with very intense eyes, looked like she had been up for a long time, she had a voice I sort of rememberd, but couldn't place it.  She was talking about "The Idiots" and said that the furthest extent was having the family involved in middle part.  I wanted to agree, but then noticed my parents at the table, so I didn't say anything.  It was funny, they weren't <a "href=http://leda.lycaeum.org/Images/Salvia_divinorum.7871.shtml">there</a>, then they were, I was bringing them in myself, holding myself back, internalized sociatel pressures.  This is the current theme in my life now, breaking through these limitations.</p>

<p>Oh wow!  This weekend I had tea and oranges with <a href="http://www.unb.ca/qwerte/bissett/">bill bissett</a> one of Canada's most amazing poets!  He's been a hero of mine for years, he's inspired me so much over the years, and I love love love his poetry (some of it is on my site).  Wow!</p>
