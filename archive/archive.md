### One of the wonderful things

One of the wonderful things about having a shaved head: Not having to worry
about falling alseep with gum in your mouth, no hair for it to get tangled up
in!  (And yes, I did suffer this trauma once, and after an hour of painful
brushing to try to remove it, had to snip some hair off to get it out, yuck!).

### Hey! I've figured it out!

### Got a new soundcard and

Got a new <a href="http://www.soundblaster.com">soundcard</a> and <a
href="http://www.radioshack.com">microphone</a> this weekend for my newly
refreshed linux box, I've been meaning to get some audio applications and hard
disk recording going on this box for some time, but since it was my main mail
and web server, I was a bit nervous.  Now that my netwinder is bravely taking
over these tasks, I'm more adventurous.  Got a midi cable as well, because I
*have* to get my Roland SPD-11 hooked up to my computer.  Now, that will
<b>rock</b>.

### Beautiful sounds in the radio

Beautiful <a href="http://www.sness.net/files/rpws_010104.wav">sounds</a> in the
radio waves near<br /> Jupiter.  Found by the <a

like ambient techno.  Now, that's what we need, streaming audio from all around
the solar system.  (hmm, as I write this, doesn't 'solar system' sound a bit
70's?  Do we need a new term?)

### Shiva level in Nethack A

<h3>Shiva level in Nethack</h3>

A portal is generated at around level 10-15 that takes you to the Shiva level.
There are 4 levels,<br /> 3 are big rooms, but completely filled with really
nasty monsters that don't leave any items.  First level is elementals, second is
golems, third is demons.  Here's the trick, if you have been a pacifist, all
these monsters will instead be figurines of these monsters.  The fourth level is
empty, except for a throne in the middle of the room.  Around the throne are an
amulet of life saving, a bag of holding,and two blessed figurines of a Archons,
Ida and Pingala.

If you have been a pacifist, Shiva is seated in the middle of the room in
meditation, and will give you the "Mantle of Shiva", which you can wear for huge
AC, protection from fire, cold, level<br /> drain and shocking.  You can apply
it in a direction and all monsters in that direction will be <br /> turned into
figurines.  You can invoke it, when invoked it summons another high level pet.

Man, I love coding little cute algorithms, I love thinking about the most
efficient way to implement algorithms, weird little data structures..  Cool. I
find in C that I stick with simpler data structures like arrays, not like how I
used to work in C++, but then there is more to keep track of in C, which makes
it fun and challenging.

  bestlist = (struct MatrixListItem **) malloc (sizeof (struct MatrixListItem*) * tot);

  for (i = 0; i < tot; i++) {<br />
	bestlist[i] = (struct MatrixListItem *) malloc (sizeof (struct MatrixListItem));<br />
	bestlist[i]->indx1 = -1;<br />

	}

  // 3) Sort this list by sulston score<br />
  qsort(bestlist, tot, sizeof(struct MatrixListItem*), compare_sulstons);<br />
  <br />

Wow!  More fun work today!  Pulled out all the code from ,<b>gactg</b> and put
it into <i>ga.c</i> and <i>ga.h</i>, then made gactg just call these routines to
do it's work.  Then, used <i>ga.[ch]</i> to add gactg functionality to
<b>contiger</b>!  So, now you can look at your contigs, and interactively run<br
/> genetic algorithms on them to fix them up.  Hopefully will put this right
into <b>FPC</b> which would rock, but might be difficult.  I'll get it going in
contiger first, then go crazy after that.

Wow, had an *incredible* week!  Wrote over 1500 lines of code, got a <br />
full GA up and running that looks very promising for doing our contig<br />
ordering!  

This takes 15 seconds to run at home (600 MHz Pentium III) for 10000 <br />
generations.  Order is perfect, except that 8 should be at the leftmost   <br />
end.

Scores are all the sulston exponents between each neighbour and the next.<br />
This tries to minimize that quantity.  It's very fast.

Cool, eh!

<a href="http://www.babaji.net">Babaji</a> Full Moon meditation this morning at
5am.  Very gentle and energetic.  Had an incredible dream before the meditation,
I was in the back seat of a car, my friend went inside a building, left the
car's engine running, but parked.  The car started driving itself in front of
the building, first just moving a little bit backwards and forwards, then in
circles.  The car was so tiny that I couldn't get over the front seat to push
the break, I was stretching but couldn't make it.  A female cop was outside,
pointing her gun at the car and being very excited generally.  It was very
hilarious!  We got the car stopped finally, I think it just stopped by itself.
Then, they took me back to my friends place, I shook the hand of the male cop,
but the female cop went upstairs before I could shake her hand, so I waited
downstairs.  She didn't come down, so I just sat at a table, and talked to a
very intense young woman with very intense eyes, looked like she had been up for
a long time, she had a voice I sort of rememberd, but couldn't place it.  She
was talking about "The Idiots" and said that the furthest extent was having the
family involved in middle part.  I wanted to agree, but then noticed my parents
at the table, so I didn't say anything.  It was funny, they weren't <a
"href=http://leda.lycaeum.org/Images/Salvia_divinorum.7871.shtml">there</a>,
then they were, I was bringing them in myself, holding myself back, internalized
sociatel pressures.  This is the current theme in my life now, breaking through
these limitations.

Oh wow!  This weekend I had tea and oranges with <a
href="http://www.unb.ca/qwerte/bissett/">bill bissett</a> one of Canada's most
amazing poets!  He's been a hero of mine for years, he's inspired me so much
over the years, and I love love love his poetry (some of it is on my site).
Wow!

### Saw Spiderman again yesterday. I

Saw <a href="http://www.spiderman.sonypictures.com">Spiderman</a> again
yesterday.  I was sitting <a
href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/question494.htm">further back</a> in the
theatre, and it was a much smaller screen, so I found myself much more able to
take in all the information from the movie, and got less dizzy than the first
time I saw it.

### Cool. First program cross-compiled under

Cool.  First program cross-compiled under MingW.  Network mounted the
/shakti/sness partition, and then I can run it directly over the net, instead of
having to move it by hand.  Neat.

### It looks like it's going

It looks like it's going to be pretty simple to do this cross-compilation
thingy, I'm looking at docs <a
href="http://www.mingw.org/docs.shtml#installation">here</a>, and I'm getting
things ready to compile a test app today.

### BTW, MO is the acronym

BTW, MO is the acronym for my new project, Molecular Origami, taking what I did
in 1988 and extending it radically to multiple dimensions and multiple genomes.
With a fully themable interface, and SOAP and XML communication.  Fully buzzword
compliant.  :)

### The database of Immigrant genes.

The <a href="http://bioinformatics.org/immigrant/">database of Immigrant
genes</a>.  Is up on <a href="http://bioinformatics.org">bioinformatics.org</a>.
A very interesting looking resource, a good candidate for inclusion in MO.

### Working with MingW to cross-compile

Working with <a href="http://www.mingw.org">MingW</a> to cross-compile code for
Windows on Linux.  Looks interesting.  I don't like the hardware OpenGL
acceleration on Linux, it's so much easier on Windows, and this way, it'll force
me to keep my codebase working on both Win and Linux at the same time.  It's a
good thing.

### Going to try to get

Going to try to get my <a
href="http://www.logitech.com/cf/support/7700.cfm">QuickCam</a> camera working
again on the Windows box.  I hope they've changed the drivers and software to
allow me to upload the pictures to a local website, it was such a bummer when
they took that feature out and forced you to upload to their website.

### Another gorgeous day today, I'm

Another gorgeous day today, I'm up and on the computer.  Latest <a
href="http://kt.zork.net/kernel-traffic/latest.html">Linux Kernel Digest</a> is
up.

I just logged into my <a href="http://www.furry.com">furry.com</a> account
again, to keep it active.  I've had my sness character since sometime in 1994, I
don't go there much at all, but I login every 3 months or so to make sure my
character doesn't get <br /> deleted.  I've got quite a little world back in
there, but don't have anyone to really share it with.  Laurel Poole was the one
who got<br /> me on there, but soon after I got my character, she left, never to
return again.  I love having old stuff like that around, it's neat to look back
at old computer stuff and remember.

Talking about that, I just got some of my old old source code off of floppies,
source code for the Molecular Origami project I did back in 1988/1989 for the
CWSF (Canada Wide Science Fair).  I'll be posting some of it up soon, it's in
Turbo Pascal, and I'm amazed at how similar my source code is now to how it was
then.  Very interesting.

couldn't get it going.  I'll try again perhaps later this week.

### MahaShivaRatri

Wow!  Tomorrow is Maha Shivaratri!  Right now it is happening in India, which is
wild to think about.  It's one of the main shiva festivals in the Hindu faith.
It's a good day to meditate and keep your mind on the divine.  That's what I'll
be doing, for sure!  :)

<a href="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/gthursby/tantra/mahashiv.htm">Here</a> is
one link about Maha Shivaratri</a> and <a

one.

The first link contains a reference to Mohenjadaro and Harappa, which will
please Chris Peet immensely, I'm sure.

<br><br>

Nethack is definitely my favorite computer game of all time, I've played it since I had a copy on the Mac Plus, back in 1988.  I remember at the time that it was so so difficult, with so many ways to die, it just blew my mind.  Back then, the big weapons were crysknives, the enchanted teeth of the adult Shai-Hulud.  So, I remember finding a long worm one time, and I was so blown away, it didn't just take up one screen position, but snaked across the dungeon.  

So, then, in 1996, I think, I found it again on Linux, and got totally immersed
in it again.  I played and played and I decided that I needed to ascend.  <a

### GSR

An interesting post on the openeeg-list today:

<pre> I've seen a couple of easy GSR projects. One of them uses 3 lines of the
parallel port and a 555 timer, "Build a biofeedback monitor" by James Barbarello
Oct 88 Radio Electronics.  Don't recall the other one, but i've done GSR with
just two quarters and an analog joystick input.. not sure if this works on PC,
worked on atari 8-bit

</pre>

Hmm, I should try this with the PS2 joystick and those intrumentation amplifier
IC's that I got a couple months ago.  That would rock to have GSR and ECG as two
inputs into the PS2.  EEG would be even better, and might be possible with a
instrumentation amplifier into the PS2 joystick controls.  Could have a total of
4 different inputs with one controller.  Hmmm.....

conjecture that the current produced from these vessels, when filled with grape
juice, could be used in electroplating, for healing, or for religous or magical
experiences.  I vote for the last one, myself.  I think they were probably
stolen, and were ancient relics even in 200BC.

retry.  You can do this quickly with X, X, O, X, if you time it well, you can go
in and check and get out in under 2 seconds.  When you buy this capsule, you'll
get MechaFreiza, a really neat and nasty tranformation for Freiza.

### Rumi

     Today, Sunlght offers two interpretations of Quatrain 1359:

<br />
           ^          ^           ^           ^           ^

Do you think I am in control here?<br />
That for a moment, or even half a moment,<br />
I can tell you what¹s going on?

I am no more than a pen in a writer¹s hand.<br />
A ball smacked around by a polo stick.

<i>           -- Version by Jonathan Star<br />
              "Rumi - In the Arms of the Beloved"<br />
              Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, New York 1997<br />
</i><br />
    

Do you think I know what I'm doing?<br />
That for one breath or half-breath<br />
I belong to myself?<br />
As much as a pen knows what it's writing<br />
or the ball can guess where it's going next.

<i>           --  Version by Coleman Barks<br />
               "The Essential Rumi"<br />
               Castle Books, 1997<br />

I remember in the summer of 1993, I was a young student in Randy Read's lab at
the UofA.  I was working on SGI computers, doing drug design.  I found this neat
new program "Mosaic", that let you look at strange things called "web pages".
No one else in the lab was excited about it, it just looked like a graphical
WAIS or gopher.  But I knew, damn it, I <b>knew</b>!  ;)

### Rumi

A disciple is like a new moon,<br />
in reality no different than the full moon:<br />
its apparent imperfection is a sign of gradual increase.<br />
Night by night the new moon gives a lesson in gradualness:<br />
with deliberation it says, "O hasty one,<br />
only step by step can one ascend to the roof."<br />
A skillful cook lets the pot boil slowly;<br />
the stew boiled in a mad hurry is of no use.

           -- Mathnawi VI:1208-1212<br />
              Version by Camille and Kabir Helminski<br />
              "Rumi: Jewels of Remembrance"<br />

<a href="http://www.rootprompt.org/">RootPrompt</a> led me to this interesting <a href="http://securityfocus.com/infocus/1674">article</a> about IP Spoofing.

"Now that we have an overview of the TCP/IP formats, let's examine the
consequences. Obviously, it's very easy to mask a source address by manipulating
an IP header. This technique is used for obvious reasons and is employed in
several of the attacks discussed below. Another consequence, specific to TCP, is
sequence number prediction, which can lead to session hijacking or host
impersonating."

### Karma Yoga

Rather than sitting back and thinking about what you don't have or what others<br />
have not done for you, it is time to take action--<br />
time to take aggressive action to find someone who has a need and fill that need.<br />
When you begin to give away what YOU WANT, you have miraculous blessings in your<br />
life!!!<br />

reach the source.

Timewave Zero is an idea that Terrence McKenna had.  He said that the pattern of hexagrams in the King Wen version of the I Ching were not random, but held structure, and when put into a specific fractal transform, could generate a number that corresponds to the amount of Novelty present.  Novelty reaches it's minimum value of 0 on Dec 12, 2012.  

I will be presenting more material about this subject later, including a Perl program to generate Novelty Reports.

### adventure racing

I want to get into adventure racing.  These people don't know how to do this
properly.<br /> They're just hikers and campers, and really the race is not
about being a hiker, it's about being something more akin to a Navy Seal or an
Army Ranger.  They should treat the course as such, and not just blunder
through, but have excellent intel, both airplane based radar maps, satellite
maps, autonomously surveyed robot maps, things like this.  I think that if I had
a really strong team, I could lead them to an easy victory.  Too bad there's not
much money in it right now.  If we take it to the next level, it could be even
bigger than Survivor.

Ok, I take back the Navy Seals and Army Rangers, there are some Rangers in this
years competetion and they are just idiots.  The team "captain" was an army
moron with no empathy for his team members, pushed one too far, and the medical
team took him out of the race.  That's so typical.

So, Mark Burnett, are you listening?  We need to take this adventure racing deal
to the next level, make it a mega Survivor + adventure racing + tech + more
cameras (+ deathsport :).  I will set it up, it's going to be pretty simple
actually, I should start writing a RFP.

Ok first though, seriously, is that they need to have better equipment.  Not
just those normal socks and shoes, but ones that can keep out the water and stop
people from getting those horrible things happening to their feet.

### cwsf

I was just at the project viewing and critiquing for the ERSF winners that are
  going to the <a href="http://www.cwsf2003.org" >2003 Canada Wide Science
  Fair</a>.  They are all very smart and cool. I had a lot of fun talking to
  them about their projects.  I had actually talked to all of the winners on my
  tours around the science fair, except for one from grade 7, who had a great
  project as well.  <br /> <br /> I just found out I'll be a judge at the <a
  href="http://www.cwsf2003.org" >2003 Canada Wide Science Fair</a>.  That's
  cool.

### don't rush it.

that's so funny, I was just watching Rocket Science, talking about Gemini 6 and 7, the rendevous in space.  They changed the plan late in the game to allow for this rendevous.  Gemini 7 went first, then Gemini 6 followed.  They had to rush to get Gemini 6 ready for launch.

So, instead of the usual 10-12 day setup, they worked around the clock and got the rocket ready in 8 days.  However, when the launch came, they had a major problem, just a few seconds after the rocket engines were starting up, they suddenly shut down.  They finally found the problem, an engine cover had accidently been left on.  After only 3 more days, the rocket was ready for launch.

That's so funny, that's 11 days total.  Sometimes, hurrying it just slows it all down.

### hgs finished

From Ars Technica: 

The final, revised version of the human genome will be <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993621"><br />
officially released</a> on Monday in Washington DC. All of the substantial holes in the three billion base units that make up our chromosomes have been filled. There are, however, some parts that are technically unsequenceable, but they only make up about 1.5% of the overall genome.  Also the <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns9999411">number of genes</a> has been more formally established.

Already, real progress has been made in the medical field, utilizing information gleaned from the human genome.

"Just one part of this work - the sequencing of chromosome 20 - has already accelerated the search for genes involved in diabetes, leukaemia and childhood eczema," [Allan Bradley, Director of the UK's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute] notes.

Scientists liken the highly-publicized 2000 version of the genome to a demo tape, and today's finished product to a classic CD. Apparently this "classic CD" version will be freely available on the web so you can download it and impress your friends, if you're so inclined.

period, it's earlier than I thought, but the Oilers are winning 2-1!  And they keep
the lead until the end, cool!  First game Oilers!  That's going to be hard for
Dallas to swallow, as long as we can keep up the momentum, maybe against
all odds, get the next game... Well, it's going to be a tough series, that's for
sure.  Edmonton are just in it from this game because Tommy Salo rocks.

i'm now watching extreme makover.  Now, that's a scary show, let me tell you.  

I just finished watching the final of American Idol.  Ruben won, thankfully.  He actually is a really good singer, and is really big, so it's really cool that he won.  He was the better singer, but Clay was a better showman.  After he lost, Clay was freaking out at the end of the show, and was acting quite weird, and squeaked like a squirrel.  Funny.

I like to read kernel traffic, it's much more efficient and fun than subscribing to the kernel list itself.  It's very high traffic, and either very technical, or "flame-y".  So, not much fun.  But kernel traffic just summarizes it all so nicely.  I prefer to read it over the course of a day, so it can sink in better, and not be as boring.  Yeah, as a Linux hacker, and kernel hacker, I should care, but I find that nowadays I just don't care about the kernel that much.  It works really well, and that's all that I'm really interested in.  Now, I'm still totally interested in open-source and most of my projects are open-source.  I just am focussing on scientific programming, right now.

### Excerpt From The Eye of

Excerpt From 
The Eye of the I: From Which Nothing Is Hidden  by Dr. David R. Hawkins<br>

From the Chapter titled  "THE MIND"  
sub-section  "The Impersonality of the Ego"<br>

While there is a belief in a singular 'me' or 'my', it seems though one is
sacrificing by letting go of the ego/mind.  It is viewed as a sacrifice because it
is thought to be something unique and precious because it is personal.  It is
helpful to realize that the ego is impersonal; it is not unique at all. 
Everybody's innate ego operates about the same as that of everybody else.  Unless
modified by spiritual evolution, all ego/selves are self-serving, egotistical,
vain, misinformed, and committed to endless gain in all its customary forms, such
as moralistic superiority, possessions, fame, wealth, adulation and control.<br>

Because of its positionality, everybody's ego results in guilt, shame, greed,
pride, anger, rage, envy, jealousy, hatred, etc.  Because the ego is constructed
of positionalities, it has no option to be anything else than what it is.  It
therefore becomes an inescapable source of endless suffering and loss.  Above all
else, it fears the future and the specter of death itself, which is intrinsic to
the ego's structure.  What the ego clings to most is its conviction of its own
existence as an independent reality.  For a while, the ego even resorts to seeking
enlightenment as a secret means of securing its survival unto Eternity.  By this
slight of hand, the spiritual ego emerges in a desperate but now sophisticated
form of survival.  Our fantasies about our reality are dear to us and we are
reluctant to relinquish them.  The process requires both courage and faith.  To
let go of the known for the unknown requires great commitment, willingness, and
devotion to surrendering one's faith to God.

Straight & Pre-Multiplied Alpha Channels

Alpha channels can be saved as straight or premultiplied.

Straight (also known as unmatted) relies solely on the alpha channel to determine opacity.

Premultiplied (also known as matted) store information in the alpha channel, but also factor in transparency information into the R, G & B channels. In premultiplied files, the nicely feathered semitransparent edges will become mixed with the background color.

Programs like After Effects interpret alpha channels as either straight or premutliplied. Using the wrong interpretation results in undesirable white fringing or halos around the perimeter of the alpha.

### LESSON 26 from Merging with

LESSON 26 from Merging with Siva 

Be Like the River Water 

You can plainly see that we have to go into the subconscious basement and <br />
straighten it out, if need be, by letting go and becoming free. That's <br />
easy to say. It's a little more difficult to do. Why? Because the basement <br />
took time to fill, and it takes time to clean. If we were to straighten <br />
out the subconscious basement too fast, that would not be good. It would <br />
be going against a natural law. It would be like pouring hot water on <br />
plants, as they do commercially, to make them bloom quickly. We must <br />
not force natural laws, so we take time in our spiritual unfoldment. The <br />
more time you are willing to take, the less pressure you have on yourself <br />
and the faster you will attain a permanent enlightenment. 

Let's look again at the river of life as it flows into the sea, and <br />
again relate that to ourselves and see ourselves letting go of the river <br />
banks, merging ourselves into this river, flowing with it and realizing <br />
ourselves as the essence of life. Let us not worry about the past ever <br />
again. Do not even think about the past. Face everything that comes up <br />
in the light of the present, not in the darkness of the past. 

Be like the river water. Water flows freely anywhere, easily finding its <br />
way around rocks and trees. Be pliable in your life, moving in rhythm with <br />
life. Let go of everything that blocks the river of life's energy. Watch <br />
your thinking and be careful of your thoughts. Judge every action that <br />
you make, judge every word you speak, with this law: "Is it true? Is it <br />
kind? Is it helpful? Is it necessary?" Become your own kind judge and <br />
make each second a day of judgment, for each second is really a day, <br />
if you live life fully. If you live completely each second, you will <br />
experience many days inside each twenty-four hours. 

Be free from life's attachments and don't allow any more negative <br />
attachments to occur in your life. Loosen yourself--be free. Attachments <br />
bring all sorts of complications. Freedom brings no complications <br />
at all. So, that is what we have to do, recreate our lives each <br />
second. Become affectionately detached and manifest a greater love <br />
through action. Selfless service to mankind makes you free in the world <br />
of mortals. Measure yourself objectively with the river of life and merge <br />
with it into the sea of life. Let your service to mankind begin at home <br />
and radiate out to the world. Begin at home, with those closest to you, <br />
before venturing out among friends and strangers. Let your example <br />
be your first teaching. Be free from the past; abide in the present; <br />
detach yourself from the future; and live in the eternal now.



	
	








### Stretching your mind - All

Stretching your mind -

All things are in a state of energy interchange with each other. Each <br />
time you look at a thing, it is different. Its energy has changed, <br />
your energy has changed. Your perception of it is co-creating it anew <br />
and placing into it, the feeling associated with the essence of the <br />
object. This is the essence of constancy of change.

              ~ Mark Greenia - Energy Dynamics<br />
***********<br />
Can we look at our relationships without going through the filter of the past?<br />
Each moment is fresh and new.  <br />
The subjective observation of any person or event is only based on personal<br />
perception.

That's ALL it is.



	
	








### There are two kinds of

There are two kinds of intelligence: one acquired,<br />
as a child in school memorizes facts and concepts<br />
from books and from what the teacher says,<br />
collecting information from the traditional sciences<br />
as well as from the new sciences.

With such intelligence you rise in the world.<br />
You get ranked ahead or behind others<br />
in regard to your competence in retaining<br />
information.  You stroll with this intelligence<br />
in and out of fields of knowledge, getting always more<br />
marks on your preserving tablets.

There is another kind of tablet,<br />
one already completed and preserved inside you.<br />
A spring overflowing its springbox.  A freshness<br />
in the center of the chest.  This other intelligence<br />
does not turn yellow or stagnate.  It's fluid,<br />
and it doesn't move from outside to inside<br />
through the conduits of plumbing-learning.

This second knowing is a fountainhead<br />
from within you, moving out.

  To follow and demonstrate the path of Truth, Simplicity and Love is man's<br />
supreme duty and the highest Yoga. Diligent work is a quality of this path, for<br />
laziness is death on earth. Only by work can one claim victory over karma. All<br />
must strive to do their duty in the best possible way and not to wander from that<br />
duty. Service to humanity is the first duty. During these times, inhumanity and<br />
laziness have increased, so it is important that you work hard and not lose heart.<br />
Be brave, be industrious; work hard and have courage.

The nicest thing that this new RedHat kernel has is good support for my Linksys WPC11 wireless PCMCIA card.  Before, I would get lots of strange errors, but those errors have now seemed to go away.  Cool.

I could also try with a newer kernel, it might have more ACPI stuff built in.

### The Architect's Speech

Originally posted at <a href="http://www.theantitrust.net/articles/viewarticle.php?articleid=108">theantitrust.net</a>

The Architect - Hello, Neo.

Neo - Who are you?

The Architect - I am the Architect. I created the matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.

Neo - Why am I here?

The Architect - Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.

Neo - You haven't answered my question.

The Architect - Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.

*The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "Others? What others? How many? Answer me!"*

The Architect - The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.

*Again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "Five versions? Three? I've been lied too. This is bullshit."*

Neo: There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.

The Architect - Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly's systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.

*Once again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "You can't control me! F*ck you! I'm going to kill you! You can't make me do anything!*

Neo - Choice. The problem is choice.

*The scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room*

The Architect - The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being, thus I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.

Neo - The Oracle.

The Architect - Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked, would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.

Neo - This is about Zion.

The Architect - You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.

Neo - Bullshit.

*The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors: "Bullshit!"*

The Architect - Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.

*Scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architects room.*

The Architect - The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals, 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.

Neo - You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.

The Architect - There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.

*The Architect presses a button on a pen that he is holding, and images of people from all over the matrix appear on the monitors*

The Architect - It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the one. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-a-vis, love.

*Images of Trinity fighting the agent from Neo's dream appear on the monitors*

Neo - Trinity.

The Architect - Apropos, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.

Neo - No!

The Architect - Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you're going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.

*Neo walks to the door on his left*

The Architect - Humph. Hope, it is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.

Neo - If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.

The Architect - We won't.

<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-03/uoa-mot031203.php">Men overestimate the number of sexual partners they have had in their lives</a>.  What is interesting is that I actually calculated this number the way that the women do, by going through each relationship.  I had previously guessed, and had guessed a higher number than the calculation revealed, so I guess I fall into both categories.  Interesting.  And no, I'm not going to tell you.

### Thursday, August 21, 2003 The

Thursday, August 21, 2003<br />
                                                                                                                                                  <br />
The only way you can successfully communicate and relate to other people, is to like yourself. The more you like yourself, the more others will like and accept you. Unfortunately, many people have experiences in their past that leave them feeling unworthy, incapable and embarrassed.<br />
                                                                                                                                                  <br />
That is all over now. It is in the past. The reality is that you're an expressive, sensitive, gregarious person, if only you'll let yourself be. It doesn't matter what someone has said about you in the past. It doesn't matter what shortcomings you have previously experienced. That is all history.<br />
                                                                                                                                                  <br />
What matters is what you do from this point forward. Realize that you are a worthwhile, valuable person with an enormous contribution to make. Find the best within yourself and feel good about the person you are. You are a special person, and your life begins today.<br />
                                                                     <br />
                                                                                                                                                  <br />
                           THE DAILY GURU<br />
                                                                                                                                                  <br />

### "Why is it that love

"Why is it that love between men and women does not last? Because, instead of linking each other to the divine Source so they may be continually renewed, they attach themselves to one another and end up exhausted. When nothing is left, they are empty vessels and reject each other. You must therefore think of your partner as a precious and unique being, and realise that it is through you that he can become vibrant, beautiful, and rich, but only if you link him to the Source: to the heavenly Father, the divine Mother, the angelic hierarchies, the sun, and the stars....

Love offers you every possibility. But if you are not enlightened, if you cling to this being instead of uniting him with Heaven, you will drain his energies; over time he will begin to break down, and your love for him will diminish. But whose fault is this? Why did you not unite him with heaven? Now you are worried, you are beginning to have doubts about him. Yet it is very simple: you have not learned how to project him high into those regions where he can drink and breathe. And he too must do the same thing for you. When you succeed in this, you are no longer simply vessels, you are inexhaustible springs for one another."

It is not those who lack energy or refrain from action, but those who work without<br />

to the results of their work are far from the path.

     I'm pleased with you and give My Word<br />
      To ease the grief of each.<br />
      My dearest vow is to protect<br />

The subsun is the most common subhorizon halo. It is a direct reflection of the sun from millions of cloud crystals acting together as a giant mirror. Plate crystals are the usual source although quite imperfect and large wobbly crystals will form a subsun. Rays can reflect externally off the uppermost horizontal face or internally from the lowermost. The halo is elongated if the crystals are tilted or oscillating

One important thing I learned was, when you are making a command line that has variables in it, surrounded by letters, you might need to protect your variables from premature expansion with braces, specifically { and }.

For example, I was writing the following, and it would fail without the braces

TTT: Tools, Tips and Tweaks<br />
Finding Shit in Linux

Finding stuff. To the uninitiated, finding files and searching within Linux is an arcane art of seemingly endless expressions and commands. With no animated dog to help us on our journey, we are forced to deal with the power of the command line.

locate - Locate is extremely useful for newbies, since you really just need to do locate foo in the command line and locate will tell you where it is. Locate is extremely quick, since it runs a service during the middle of the night to keep its index updated. Unfortunately, since this index is only updated once a day, if you are looking for new files, you need to run updatedb as root to get it to update, which can be time consuming.

find - This brings us to find, which gives us a bit more flexibility as far as being able to pass certain parameters. Some basic uses for find are find / -name foo, which will look for all files with the string foo in the filename, starting at /. If you want to get very specific find / -regex pattern will let you use a regular expression. Regular expressions are an important part of the command line and programming in general. The man page for find has a wealth of information on other options, and find is probably the most well rounded useful tool to learn. 

which - ever wonder where a command is located? Where do they put tar and gunzip anyway? For this we have the which command. Try which gunzip, and you'll see that which tells us that the file is in /bin.

whereis - Now let's say we need to find out where more than just the binary is. For this we have whereis, a specific command used to search for the location of source, binary, and manuals of a specific package. In this example, notice how whereis shows us the location of the binary, source, and man page for the command tar: <br />
jorge@piccolo:~$ whereis tar<br />
tar: /bin/tar /usr/include/tar.h /usr/share/man/man1/tar.1.gz<br />
jorge@piccolo:~$<br />
 

grep - Grep is great, it searches inside files for certain patterns and regular expressions (we told you they were useful!), and then displays them for you. As a general example, grep -e Linux index.html will search for the word "Linux" in a file called index.html and spit out every line that has that word. Grep has three brothers, egrep, fgrep, and rgrep. egrep is used when you want to use a regular expression as the search parameter. fgrep is used when you want to use a list of fixed strings as the search parameter. And lastly, rgrep is used when you want to recursively search under each directory.

As you can see, grep is a powerful tool. Combined with find and regular expressions, a Linux user can use them in combinations to match any need. Caesar loves 'grep -rl "string" *', because he can use it to search all of Ars for a string, and manage broken links that way.

whoami - Our last tool is whoami. Ever get lost su'ing from user to user and then wondering why a command won't work? Run this tool from the prompt to see who you are logged in as at the moment.

Solar storm could spark catastrophe



A "perfect space storm" that occurred 144 years ago could happen again at any time with catastrophic consequences, scientists have warned.

Newly uncovered scientific data has shown the true extent of history's most massive electromagnetic storm which blew up on the first two days of September 1859.

Like "the perfect storm" at sea which inspired a blockbuster movie, it was the result of a number of titanic events coming together.

But in this case the centre of the storm was the sun, not the ocean.

A combination of sunspots and solar flares produced an explosive release of magnetically charged gas and particles which sped towards the Earth.



When the storm struck, the effects had a huge impact even on the limited technological landscape of the 19th century.

Within hours, telegraph wires in both the United States and Europe spontaneously shorted out, causing numerous fires.

People were amazed as the Northern Lights - caused by charged solar particles bombarding the atmosphere near the northern magnetic pole - illuminated the sky as far south as Rome, Havana and Hawaii.

Dr Bruce Tsurutani, a plasma physicist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who has investigated the event, said: "What happened in 1859 was a combination of several events that occurred on the sun at the same time.

"If they took place separately they would be somewhat notable events. But together they create the most potent disruption of Earth's ionosphere in recorded history. What they generated was the perfect space storm."

The amount of power locked within the sun is almost beyond comprehension.

At almost 900,000 miles wide, the Sun contains 99.86 per cent of the mass of the entire solar system - enough room to accommodate well over a million Earths.

The total energy radiated by the sun averages 383 billion trillion kilowatts, equivalent to 100 billion tons of TNT exploding every second.

Close inspection of the sun's surface reveals a turbulent tangle of magnetic fields and boiling arc-shaped clouds of plasma dappled by dark, roving sunspots.

On August 28, 1859, solar observers noted the development of numerous sunspots - localised regions of very intense magnetic fields - on the sun's surface.

The fields intertwined, generating violent solar flares. From August 28 several flares were observed, said Dr Tsurutani.

Then, on September 1, the sun released a single mammoth solar flare. For almost a minute, the amount of light the sun produced at the region of the flare doubled.

With the flare came an event called a coronal mass ejection (CME), a volcanic eruption on the sun. A huge cloud of plasma, a turbulent mass of electrically charged gas, was blasted into space.

It moved fast, taking just 17 hours and 40 minutes to reach the Earth. The magnetic fields it contained were extremely intense and in direct opposition to the Earth's fields.

The magnetic "shield" that surrounds the Earth was overwhelmed, allowing charged particles to enter the upper atmosphere.

Back in 1859 the invention of the telegraph was only 15 years old and electrical systems were in their infancy. But the potential effects of such solar events have been demonstrated more than once in modern times.

In March 1989 a solar storm much less intense than the one of 1859 knocked out the Hydro-Quebec power grid in Canada for more than nine hours. Resulting damages and losses were estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars.

A similar event in 1994 caused major malfunctions to two communications satellites, disrupting newspaper, network television and radio services throughout Canada. Other storms have affected cell phone services, TV signals and Global Positioning Systems.

In today's technologically dependent world, a storm of 1859 magnitude would cause enormous damage and disruption.

Dr Tsurutani, whose findings were published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, said: "The question I get asked most often is, `could a perfect space storm happen again, and when?' I tell people it could, and it could very well be even more intense than what transpired in 1859. As for when, we simply do not know."

The magic words:<br />

puts "snesstest BEFORE - OUTPUT_XML $array(OUTPUT_XML)"<br />
set array(OUTPUT_XML) [XmlStatus]

puts "snesstest AFTER - OUTPUT_XML $array(OUTPUT_XML)"<br />
puts "snesstest TEST_SNESS $array(TEST_SNESS)"<br />
</pre>

So, the way in the CCP4i interface to reference the value of a variable defined in the .def file is by looking at $array(VARIABLE_NAME).

Some gotchas:

1) Although the task .tcl code is executed each time you run the interface, the .def file is just read in once, so you need to restart the CCP4i interface after changing values in the .def file.<br />
2) To set the XML preference to YES, go to CCP4i preferences -> XML Output.

### 

A very long lived and interesting plant, the<a href="http://www.namibweb.com/welwitschia.htm">Welwitschia</a>.  Found only in the Namib desert, it reverses the water absorption cycle.  Unlike most plants, which draw in water from the roots, transport it up the stem, and then out through stroma in the leaves, this plant absorbs moisture from fog in the air and transmits it through the rest of the plant.  Can live at least 2000 years.  A relation to the conifers.  Has only two leaves.

Automating Tasks

Two trial initiatives for automating tasks within CCP4i are included in 1.3.8, both of which involve passing information via XML files.<br />
Parameter passing in Molecular Replacement 

Background: before running the Molrep task it is useful to know certain details such as the number of monomers expected in the unit cell, and the existance of pseudotranslation vectors. These can be determined using the ``Cell Content Analysis'' and ``Analyse MR Data'' tasks respectively from the Molecular Replacement module, but in each case the data must be manually transfered from the log files to the Molrep interface.

In this pilot project, both the ``Cell Content Analysis'' and ``Analyse MR Data'' tasks generate XML output files recording key information. These files are generated by calls to the CCP4 XML-writing library PXXML within the MATTHEWS_COEFF and PEAKMAX programs, activated using the XMLOUT keyword in each.

The Molrep task can then automatically check for the existence of these output files and use the information in them to fill out the appropriate fields in the task interface for the user, reducing manual handling and typographical errors.

Reading of the XML files is performed using a set of utility functions built upon xml.tcl 1.9 and sgml.tcl 1.7, both included in CCP4i 1.3.8. (Note that the XML output of ``Cell Content Analysis'' has to be processed, with the number of monomers used being estimated as that number giving a solvent fraction closest to 50% of the unit cell.)

This option is turned off by default in CCP4i 1.3.8. Users wishing to try it can switch on the functionality in the ``XML Output'' folder in their ``Preferences'' (accessed from the menu on the RHS of the main window).<br />
CAD AutoReindexing 

Background: occasionally when merging together MTZ files using CAD, it is possible that some will have different indexing conventions to the others leading to errors when combining them.

The CAD task now includes the option to ``Automatically check and enforce consistent indexing between files''. With this option selected each MTZ file is checked for consistent indexing against the first file, which is used as a reference. Files which are differently indexed are then reindexed prior to being merged. This mechanism cuts down on the overhead of manually diagnosing and correcting such cases when they arise.

This option uses XML passing within a single task rather than between tasks, as in the previous example. In this case ALMN is used to diagnose whether reindexing is required between two files, and if so then which reindexing operator to use. This information is written to a temporary XML file using the same mechanism as before, and is read from within the script using Tcl XML utilties.

In both these examples it would also have been possible to pass the same information using other mechanisms, for example by processing the log files directly using a variant on ``grep'' and other Unix-type cutting-and-sorting tools. However such methods are usually overly-complicated and prone to being easily broken by even small changes to log file formats. In contrast XML parameter passing is far simpler, more robust and easily extensible.

### 

Two cute grep commands for protein structures in .pdb files:

<b>1) Count the number of residues in a .pdb file</b><br />
For this one, I strongly suggest using the first command with "less" first, to make sure there aren't any weirdly named waters or other co-factors.  If there are, just add them to the "grep -v" section.

Explanation:<br />
First, we remove the REMARK card.  Then we grep for an ATOM or HETATOM (hetero-atom) card.  Then, we cut out both the residue name and number (it's important to get the residue number as well, as you could have two or more residues in a row with the same name.  Then we remove any "WAT or HOH" (water molecules).  Then, we use uniq, which makes a list of just the uniq lines.  Then we count up all the lines.  Simple.

<pre>
grep -v REMARK filename.pdb | grep "ATOM\|HETATM" | cut -b18-26 | grep -v "WAT\|HOH" | uniq | less
grep -v REMARK filename.pdb | grep "ATOM\|HETATM" | cut -b18-26 | grep -v "WAT\|HOH" | uniq | wc -l
</pre>

<b>Count the number of each type of atom in a .pdb file</b><br />
This one is a lot simpler, just cut out the atom type field, sort them and use uniq with the -c flag, to count all the occurences.  Neat. <br />
<pre><br />
grep "^ATOM\|^HETATM" 1e3m.pdb | cut -c13-14 | sort | uniq -c<br />
</pre>

ARP/wARP errors

I got the following error in ARP/wARP:

<pre>
cp: cannot stat `/home/sness/Paper/arp-warp-all/arp_warp_runs/haptbrSHARP/1_mir_model_1.pdb': No such file or directory
grep: arp_0.pdb: No such file or directory
grep: arp_0.pdb: No such file or directory
 Refmac_5.1.24:  No Scatterers

</pre>

This was due to an error in the ARP/wARP scripts where MAPMASK was making the wrong sized maps.  You can fix this by changing the <b>xyzlim</b> keyword in the ARP/wARP .par (parameter) file.

If you bake bread with the wheat that grows on my grave<br />
you'll become drunk with joy and<br />
even the oven will recite ecstatic poems.<br />
If you come to pay your respects<br />
even my gravestone will invite you to dance<br />
so don't come without your drum.<br />
Don't be sad. You have come to God's feast.<br />
Even death cannot stop my yearning<br />
for the sweet kiss of my love.<br />
Tear my shroud and wear it as a shirt,<br />
the door will open and you'll hear<br />
the music of your soul fill the air.<br />
I am created from the ecstasy of love and<br />
when I die, my essence will be released<br />
like the scent of crushed rose petals.<br />
My soul wants to leap and join<br />
the towering soul of Shams.<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />

It's because your map has the slow, intermediate, fast sections in the wrong order.  One way to fix this is to use SFTOOLS to read your map in and output it in the correct order:

Remembering me at the time of death, close down the doors of the senses and place the mind in the heart. Then, while absorbed in meditation, focus all energy upwards to the head. Repeating in this state the divine Name, the syllable Om that represents the changeless Brahman, you will go forth from the body and attain the supreme goal.<br />

Excerpt from Sri Shastriji at Siddhashram Schweibenalp, May 10, 1985<br />
(full text at www.babaji.net in the 'who is shastriji' section, then Shastriji's Speeches link)<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />
The change of the heart can change kranti (revolution) into shanti (peace). As great scientists are working every minute of their waking hours to create<br />
nuclear and other weapons to destroy mankind, the same way you should be partaking in this great effort of repeating "Om Namaha Shivaya" or any other great mantra that you want to recite, and with this force, change the course of annihilation into peace. For spiritual strength is much greater, thousands of times greater, than material might. Sri Mahaprabhuji appeared to us for the benefit of mankind, to give all the good mankind was lacking. He wanted harmony and for mankind to be one family, only that there should be no class or caste distinctions. He wanted all the world to live together I harmony.<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />
Every country, all nations should be brothers. There should be no distinctions between colors, black, or white, or yellow. Everybody in harmony, unitedly, enjoying this beautiful creation of the Lord. As you all have gathered here and are doing this beautiful job in this most beautiful place, the same way, spread the message of Sri Mahaprabhuji, of truth, simplicity and love to the maximum amount of people, to all corners of the world and start gathering together in harmony, in peace, in love and truth and simplicity, to live in that manner and unite the world as one big family. At the end of every speech Sri Mahaprabhuji always used to say, "Be fearless and the moment that you become fearless, nothing on this earth can touch you. No catastrophe, no other adverse force can touch you!"<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />

  The purpose of nama japa is to help focus the mind on<br />
the Divine.  Frequent repetition of the mantra focuses one's<br />
mind more and more on The Divine and other unnecessary, distracting thoughts<br />
are crowded out.  So a mantra helps focus<br />
the mind in two ways - toward the Divine and away from the "trash"<br />
that often accumulates in our minds and clutters up our mental computer<br />
discs.  Who cares what witty response you might have made to the put-down at<br />
last nights's party, and how long do remember the dreams you spin as you go<br />
to work?  How many hours a day are our minds half-focused on the<br />
mind-chatter"?<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />
  Lord Krishna, in the Bagavad Gita, told Arjuna,"...you must remember me at<br />
all times and do your duty.  If your mind and heart<br />
are set on me constantly, you will come to Me. Never doubt<br />
this." Isaiah commented on the power of this focus on the Divine<br />
in these words:  "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind<br />
is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee."<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />

reflect on how, and thanks to whom, they came about. Bring them often to mind, exactly as you play the music you love, and you will re-live the same<br />

  "(An) attribute of perfection is justice and impartiality.<br />
This means to have no regard for one's own personal<br />
benefits and selfish advantages, and to carry out the<br />
laws of God without the slightest concern for anything else.<br />
It means to see one's self as only one of the servants of God, the<br />
All-Possessing, and except for aspiring to spiritual distinction,<br />
never attempting to be singled out form others.  It means to<br />
consider the welfare of the community as one's own.  It means, in brief to<br />
regard humanity as a single individual, and one's own self<br />
as a member of that corporeal from, and to know of a certainty that<br />
if pain and injury afflicts any member of that body, it must inevitably<br />
result in suffering for all the rest."<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />

Ok, here's a very useful little change to make to the xemacs list-mode.el source file:

<pre>
;              (frame-width (or (last-nonminibuf-frame)
;                   (selected-frame)))
; sness
               (window-width (get-lru-window (last-nonminibuf-frame)))
</pre>

Comment out the first two lines and add the last line.  This solves a very annoying bug when using Xemacs in tty mode with a C-x 3 vertically split screen.  The bug is that when you do completion in this split window, the contents are created before the window is created, and if the window isn't as wide as the frame, part of the window will be truncated.  This hides some of the filenames that you're looking for, and is quite irritating.  

I found this great patch on the web <a href="http://list-archive.xemacs.org/xemacs-beta/200009/msg00137.html">here</a>.  It looks like it might be going into the beta xemacs 21.5. 

Hopefully all of this verbosity will help google find this page for you, dear reader, with a variety of search terms.  Bon chance.

HAPPY, LUMINOUS AND FRUITFUL YEAR 2004 !<br />
Prosveta Publishing is pleased to offer you the Daily Meditation for this 2004-01-15.<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />
"If you are insignificant and little known in society, you are powerless to intervene in the affairs of state. To be able to do so, you must go all the way to the centre (or to the summit, which is symbolically the same) where the king or president is to be found, and become his minister. At that moment, yes, you have every possibility, because you have reached the central point, or the zenith. As long as you remain below, or on the periphery, no-one listens to you. And the same law applies in the spiritual realm. As long as you do not succeed in reaching the centre or the summit within you, that is to say your spirit, you can achieve certain things, of course, but you are not truly in charge of anything. Whereas once you manage to link with your spirit, you are the master, because this centre affords you all possibilities, and you are fully in charge. So, stop being concerned with achievements that are futile and transitory; work to reach the spirit within you, without worrying about the time it will take."<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />

from 'Find God In Joy' by Paramahansa Yogananda.

'No matter what causes it, when ever a little bubble of Joy appears in your invisible sea of consciousness, take hold of it, and keep expanding it!Meditate on it and it will grow larger. Watch not the limitations of the little bubble of your joy, but keep expanding it until it grows bigger and bigger. Keep puffing at it with the breath of concentration from within, until it spreads all over the Ocean of Infinity in your consciousness. Keep puffing at the bubble of Joy until it breaks its confining walls and becomes the SEA OF JOY!'<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />

Controlling the Post-Startup Environment

Most Macintosh users know about holding the Shift key down to prevent extensions from loading, but there are numerous startup modifiers that affect the state of the system after the boot process finishes.

* Shift causes the Mac to boot without extensions, which is useful for troubleshooting extension conflicts. If you hold down Shift after all the extensions have loaded but before the Finder launches, it also prevents any startup items from launching.

* Spacebar launches Apple's Extensions Manager early in the startup process so you can enable or disable extensions before they load. Casady & Greene's Conflict Catcher, if you're using it instead of Extensions Manager, also launches if it sees you holding down the spacebar, or, optionally, if Caps Lock is activated. Conflict Catcher also adds the capability to configure additional startup keys as ways of specifying that a particular startup set should be used. Choose Edit Sets from the Sets menu, select a set in the resulting dialog and click Modify. In the sub-dialog that appears, you can specify a startup key and check the checkbox to make it effective.

* Option, if held down as the Finder launches, closes any previously open Finder windows. On stock older Macs, holding down Option does nothing at startup by default, although some extensions may deactivate if Option is held down when they attempt to load; see below for Option's effect on new Macs and Macs with Zip drives.

* Control can cause the Location Manager to prompt you to select a location. Although Control is the default, you can redefine it in the Location Manager's Preferences dialog, and since Control held down at startup also activates Apple's MacsBug debugger (see below), you may wish to pick a different key combination.

* Command turns virtual memory off until the next restart.

* Shift-Option disables extensions other than Connectix's RAM Doubler (and MacsBug - see below). To disable RAM Doubler but no other extensions, hold down the tilde (~) key at startup.

Choosing Startup Disks

Not surprisingly, many of the startup modifiers affect the disk used to boot the Mac. A number of these are specific to certain models of the Macintosh.

* The mouse button causes the Mac to eject floppy disks and most other forms of removable media, though not CD-ROMs. *?*

* The C key forces the Mac to start up from a bootable CD-ROM, if one is present, which is useful if something goes wrong with your startup hard disk. This key doesn't work with some older Macs or clones that didn't use Apple CD-ROM drives; they require Command- Shift-Option-Delete instead (see below).

* Option activates the new Startup Manager on the iBook, Power Mac G4 (AGP Graphics), PowerBook (FireWire), and slot-loading iMacs. The Startup Manager displays a rather cryptic set of icons indicating available startup volumes, including any NetBoot volumes that are available. On some Macs with Iomega Zip drives, holding down Option at startup when there is a Zip startup disk inserted will cause the Mac to boot from the Zip disk.

* Command-Shift-Option-Delete bypasses the disk selected in the Startup Disk control panel in favor of an external device or from CD-ROM (on older Macs). This is also useful if your main hard disk is having problems and you need to start up from another device. (On some PowerBooks, however, this key combination merely ignores the internal drive, which isn't as useful.)

* The D key forces the PowerBook (Bronze Keyboard and FireWire) to boot from the internal hard disk.

* The T key forces the PowerBook (FireWire) (and reportedly the Power Mac G4 (AGP Graphics), though I was unable to verify that on my machine) to start up in FireWire Target Disk Mode, which is essentially the modern equivalent of SCSI Disk Mode and enables a PowerBook (FireWire) to act as a FireWire-accessible hard disk for another Macintosh.

<br />
Seriously Tweaky Startup Modifiers

Only programmers and the most geeky of users will find these startup modifiers useful.

* Control activates Apple's MacsBug debugger as soon as it loads. If you rely on this frequently, you may want to redefine the default key for selecting the Location Manager location at startup from Control to something else.

* Shift-Option disables extensions and virtual memory but still loads MacsBug, which would otherwise be disabled by the Shift key.

* Command-Option-O-F puts you into Open Firmware mode on PCI-based Macs and clones. Open Firmware is a cross-platform firmware standard for controlling hardware that all PCI-based Macs use. It's mostly of interest to hardware developers, but it can be a fun way to freak out a new user who's not expecting to see a command line on the Mac. To exit Open Firmware and continue booting, type "mac-boot" or "bye" (depending on Macintosh model) and press Return. For a list of commands you can enter while in Open Firmware mode, see the Tech Info Library article.

Just for Fun

Although Apple has moved away from relatively frivolous "Easter Eggs" connected with startup modifiers, there are a few available for old Macintosh models.

* Command-X-O, when held down at startup on a Macintosh Classic boots the Classic from a built-in ROM disk.

* Command-Option-C-I, when held down at startup on a Macintosh IIci whose date has been set to 20-Sep-89 (the machine's introduction date), produces some sort of graphical display that I can't check for lack of a relevant machine. A different display appears if you hold down Command-Option-F-X at startup on a Macintosh IIfx with the date set to 19-Mar-90.

### last one for today

scariest yet.  everything I learned today in one shiny package.

<pre>
find . -name '*arp_warp.log' -cmin -30 -exec sh -c "grep 'Building Cycle' /dev/null {} | tail -1" \;
</pre>




	
	








### 

Thank you <a href="http://www.ccs.uky.edu/~mahesh/unixtips.html">Unix Guru List</a>.  You rocked my world by showing me how to do multiple commands in a find command:

Their's:

<pre>
find . -xdev -type d -exec /bin/echo -n {} \; -exec sh -c "ls {} | wc -l" \;
</pre>

But, really, stripped down to it's basics, to run multiple commands, it's:

<pre>
find . -exec sh -c "ls {} | wc -l" \;
</pre>

Sweetness.  Find running multiple commands in a pipe-d exec.  This does a neat trick, it runs "sh" (the Bourne Shell (probably the bash shell on your box)) with the -c argument, meaning, take the next string as the script to execute.

Ok, now I can take over the world.



	
	








### find rocks.

OK, my killer find command of the day.  Oh yeah, "alias c clear".

<pre>
c ; find . -name '*_arp_warp.log' -cmin -10 -exec sh -c 'grep "Building Cycle" {} | tail -1' \;
</pre>

Cool.

This one looks through a CCP4i directory for running arp_warp jobs and tells you what cycle each one is in.  Add a "-print" or "-printf" (before the -exec) for more fun.

DW 9002 Double Bass Drum Pedal</a><br />
I always wanted Drum Workshop pedals, so bad.  But way too expensive and I didn't like the upraised logo on the pedal, hard on the voeten. 

However, since I'm going all out here on the <b>ultimate sness drum set</b>, why not.

Roland SPD-11</a>

I have this one.  I bought it back in 1999.  Very sweet.  Still a little loud for an apartment though.  Within a proper drumset, it would play a critical and fun part.  I see it as providing all the bass drum sounds, as well as all the tomtom sounds, special effects and MIDI control.

For the bass drum, I know, I know, an acoustic one is nice.  But, but with the spd-11 hooked up to a good subwoofer, you can get some killer bass drum sounds, and a wide variety of kinds of bass drum sounds.  Way better than a big huge, hard to transport drum capable of just making one sound.

In a drumming utopia, I'd have both electronic and acoustic.

<img alt="fx_remixcrash.jpg" src="http://www.sness.net/weblog/archives/fx_remixcrash.jpg" width="144" height="107" border="0" />

A colorful, short, fast crash. A rich musical sound that is all "crash" with almost no sustain. Concentrated sound that speaks and then cuts out immediately. Full-bodied and quite powerful for it's size. Very versatile.<br />
 

     <br />

An alarmingly faithful acoustic recreation of the ride beat sound heard on the most common "breakbeat" loops. Joins the existing Re-Mix range now giving the "Techno" player the full spectrum of cymbal sounds for modern electronically influenced music.  <br />

Oriental Crash of Doom</a><br />
A truly one of a kind monster Crash. Ultra-trashy, very dark and low pitched. Features an immediate, explosive attack and a tremendous, broad, full-bodied sustain. An exceptionally exotic sound for special accents and effects. The 18" is higher-pitched, but equally trashy.<br />

### Julia Butterfly Hill - Tree dancer

From the <a href="http://www.mailermailer.com/x?oid=17943f">Circle of Life mailing list</a>:

<i class="julia"><br />
Julia's 30 Candles

Thoughts From Julia Butterfly Hill<br />
My 30th Birthday<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />
I'm turning 30. Gasp! "How does it feel?" everyone asks. I laugh. It feels like another day to me. I almost feel badly for my blasé response--as if I should be apologizing or something. But the reality is, I don't know if I have ever felt age appropriate. When I was little, I grew old really quickly; and now that I am getting older and have had more than one close brush with death, I feel like I am growing younger in many respects.

I've never fit very well into the roles expected of me. Of course these days, I don't know if anyone knows what to expect--least of all me.

I am full to overflowing with possibilities. I have 101 projects I want to do, and it is taking much of my time just doing the feasibility research for them. And because I am such a "doer," I am always chomping at the bit, ready to break into a full-fledged gallop even when I know I should steady the pace. This is a lifetime marathon after all, not a sprint.<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />
So I guess, if anything, I am just going through yet another gawky teenager stage; only this time I am going through it as I make the leap from my 20s into my 30s. So I proclaim it proudly--with no asterisks, no sidebar notations, and absolutely no idea what it actually means--"I am 30 years old!" It seems I know a heck of a lot about what 30 is not; and if anything, my gift to myself is the unknown excitement of discovering what 30 is--at least for me.<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />
So here's to another solar rotation, a monarch butterfly's winged migration, a bus powered by veggie oil in motion, a reclaiming democracy mobilization, and a reinvigorated, revolutionary Love-resolution.<br />
                                                                                                                                                               <br />
Lots of love and laughter, julia b<br />
</i>

### Rush : Rivendell

Sunlight dances through the leaves<br />
Soft winds stir the sighing trees<br />
Lying in the warm grass<br />
Feel the sun upon your face<br />
Elven songs and endless nights<br />
Sweet wine and soft relaxing lights<br />
Time will never touch you<br />
Here in this enchanted place<br />
Chorus<br />
You feel there's something calling you<br />
You're wanting to return<br />
To where the misty mountains rise and friendly fires burn<br />
A place you can escape the world<br />
Where the dark lord cannot go<br />
Peace of mind and sanctuary by loud water's flow<br />
I've traveled now for many miles<br />
It feels so good to see the smiles of<br />
Friends who never left your mind<br />
When you were far away<br />
From the golden light of coming dawn<br />
Till the twilight where the sun is gone<br />
We treasure every season<br />
And every passing day<br />
We feel the coming of a new day<br />
Dark gives way to light a new way<br />
Stop here for a while until the world,<br />
The world calls you away<br />
Yet you know I've had the feeling<br />
Standing with my senses reeling<br />
This is the place to grow old 'til<br />
I reach my final day.<br />
Chorus<br />
 <br />

particularly comfortable, and your choice of exactly 1 or 3 hand grips. You'd<br />
have to buy brakes, gears and chains seperatly, and a lot of the most popular<br />

and on the other side <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=7038">scripting languages</a>. 

I think they all have a place, assembly rocks for speed, C is fast and good, C++ is great for bigger projects, Tcl is great for quick scripts that might need GUI's, Perl is awesome for regexps, Python is good for quickly building applications, and has good integration with C, FORTRAN has great math libraries.

In my latest project, I've had to code in C, C++, Bourne shell, Python, Tcl and FORTRAN.  Tcl was the most fun.  C made me feel the best about myself.  FORTRAN was painful.  With Bourne shell, I was amazed at how much I could do.

### trees

Some types of tree datastructures

<ol>
<li><a href="http://searchdatabase.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid13_gci509290,00.html">binary-tree</a>
A binary tree is a method of placing and locating files (called records or keys) in a database, especially when all the data is known to be in random access memory (RAM). The algorithm finds data by repeatedly dividing the number of ultimately accessible records in half until only one remains.
<img alt="binarytree.gif" src="http://www.sness.net/weblog/archives/binarytree.gif" width="178" height="217" border="0" />
</li>

<li><a href="http://searchdatabase.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid13_gci509290,00.html">B-tree</a><br />
A B-tree is a method of placing and locating files (called records or keys) in a database. (The meaning of the letter B has not been explicitly defined.). The maximum number of children per node is the order of the tree. The number of required disk accesses is the depth.<br />
<img alt="btree.gif" src="http://www.sness.net/weblog/archives/btree.gif" width="179" height="215" border="0" /><br />
</li>

<li><a href="http://searchdatabase.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid13_gci509290,00.html">quad tree</a><br />
A quad tree is a method of placing and locating files (called records or keys) in a database. The algorithm finds data by repeatedly dividing the number of ultimately accessible records in four parts until only one remains.<br />
<img alt="quad_tree.gif" src="http://www.sness.net/weblog/archives/quad_tree.gif" width="269" height="187" border="0" /><br />

<li><a href="http://searchdatabase.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid13_gci509290,00.html">splay tree</a><br />
A splay tree is a self-adjusting search algorithm for placing and locating files (called records or keys) in a database. The algorithm finds data by repeatedly making choices at decision points called nodes.<br />

<a href="http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20040506a.html"><img alt="08-AK-01-traverse-map-B093R1_br.jpg" src="http://www.sness.net/weblog/archives/08-AK-01-traverse-map-B093R1_br.jpg" width="500" height="375" border="0" /></a><br />
This map illustrates the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit's position as of sol 112 (April 26, 2004), near the crater called "Missoula." Like a train on a tight schedule, Spirit will make regular stops along the way to its ultimate destination, the "Columbia Hills." At each stop, or "station," the rover will briefly analyze the area's rocks and soils. Each tick mark on the rover's route represents one sol's worth of travel, or about 60 to 70 meters (200 to 230 feet). Rover planners estimate that Spirit will reach the hills around mid-June. Presently, the rover is stopped at a site called "Plains Station." 

The color thermal data show how well different surface features hold onto heat. Red indicates warmth; blue indicates coolness. Areas with higher temperatures are more likely to be rocky, as rocks absorb heat. Lower temperatures denote small particles and fewer rocks. During its traverse, Spirit will document the causes of these temperature variations. 

The map comprises data from the camera on NASA's Mars Global Surveyor orbiter and the thermal emission imaging system on NASA's Mars Odyssey orbiter.

A poem for Manchester.

Vote for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/arts/2004/05/05/poem1.shtml">this poem</a>.

Ok, not just yet, but <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/arts/2004/05/05/poem_update.shtml">soon!</a>

And, the poem with proper formatting:

<pre>
i came late, to manchester.
                                          
i circumambulated its music like hills, sweeping in on the smiths, an atlantic vulture, hungry for fog.
historically, i peaked over peeks from an unknown northern town.
now i search for my own industry
lost among the farms of didsbury.

To fix this, try the above commands.  These stop Emacs from using stylesheets, which is usually the place that people put color commands in, nowadays.

Adverse Effects

The consequences of high doses or long-term use of licorice are<br />
severe. This herb can cause high blood pressure, low levels of<br />
potassium, fluid retention and swelling of the face and limbs,<br />
hormonal imbalance, and muscle destruction leading to pain and<br />
weakness.

At least one woman experienced loss of libido. Another woman ate<br />
too much licorice candy and lost a great deal of potassium; her<br />
heart stopped.

Licorice can also change heart rhythms, prolonging QT and PR<br />
intervals on an electrocardiogram.

Lethargy and fatigue as well as weakness are part of the picture of<br />
licorice toxicity.

Many of the negative symptoms associated with licorice are due to<br />
its ability to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Elderly people in<br />
particular are susceptible to kidney problems as a consequence of<br />
licorice.

Paralysis of the legs (and in one case, of all of the limbs) has been<br />
reported. A sixty-four-year-old man developed pulmonary edema,<br />
signaled by fatigue and trouble breathing, after eating four<br />
packages of black Twizzlers licorice candy in three days. This<br />
case demonstrates how quickly a serious reaction can arise.<br />
Licorice can reduce thyroid gland activity and lower the basal<br />
metabolic rate.

It appears that individuals vary considerably in their susceptibility to<br />
adverse reactions from licorice. Some people experience negative<br />
symptoms within days, while others may ingest excessive licorice<br />
in candy, chewing gum, chewing tobacco, or herbal medicine for<br />
months or even years before they realize that they are suffering<br />
damaging effects.

Women appear to be somewhat more susceptible than men, and<br />
oral contraceptives may increase this sensitivity.

Structural Models for the Alkaline Conformers of Yeast iso-1-Ferricytochrome c

Abstract: 

Structural models for three alkaline conformers of yeast iso-1- ferricytochrome c have been calculated from the atomic coordinates of the native protein through the use of molecular dynamics simulation. In the three models produced by this work, the Met80 axial ligand to the heme iron has been replaced by either Lys72, Lys73, or Lys79, and the related changes in structure of the cytochrome are described. The principal changes in cytochrome structure predicted to result from this pH-linked change in axial ligation involve location of residues 70 80, a region of the protein sequence that is phylogenetically conserved. The remainder of the protein fold in each model is essentially unchanged from the structure of the native protein, which is consistent with available spectroscopic information. The observation that this highly conserved region is apparently integrally involved in this conformational change may be interpreted as indicating a possible physiological role for the pH-linkage of ferricytochrome c structure.

Healing always involves acknowledging pain or sickness on some level. As far as I can tell, affirming problems in clear terms is the best thing we can do in preparation for resolving them. In much the same way, we do tend to set up our lives such that pain is the most credible teacher. Are you ready for a new method of learning? I really hope so, because you are now being given one. But note this: to learn from creativity involves trading in the lessons of pain for another way of life. To learn from love involves gambling away the loneliness that has become so familiar. Is this really a risk? 

thank you, srg.

Hear, O children of immortal bliss,<br />
You are born to be united with the Lord.<br />
Follow the path of the illumined ones<br />
And be united with the Lord of Life.

Kindle the fire of kundalini deep<br />
In meditation. Bring your mind and breath<br />
Under control. Drink deep of divine love,<br />
And you will attain the unitive state.

Dedicate yourself to the Lord of Life,<br />
Who is the cause of the cosmos. He will<br />
Remove the cause of all your suffering<br />
And free you from the bondage of karma.

Like many of the Earth's invisible rhythms, the field reversals are typically slow, taking anywhere from 5,000 to 7,000 years to complete.

Strong evidence of their reality first emerged in the 1950's and 1960's when scientists towing magnetic sensors behind ships found that the rocky seabed exhibited odd stripes of magnetization.

It turned out that continuous flows of seabed lava became alternately magnetized over the ages as the polarities of the Earth's field switched one way, then the other. The seabed acted like a huge tape recorder, and the same proved true of the layered deposits of old volcanoes on land.

How did the rocky memories form? Molten lava proved to hold tiny mineral grains that acted like innumerable compasses, or miniature magnets, freely aligning themselves with the contemporary field. But as the lava cooled, the tiny compasses froze in place, immobile even if the field shifted. Experts called it paleomagnetism and found that the tiny compasses were often made of magnetite, a naturally magnetic mineral.

<a href="http://www.psc.edu/~dnave/notes/w2kvmw.phtml">sweet</a> - instructions for getting vmware to run off a non-bootable cdrom.

<pre>
You are here: www.psc.edu/ D. Nave @ psc.edu/ D. Nave's Notes/ Installing Win2K from CD in VM-Ware 3.2 for Linux 

To install Windows 2000 Professional in VM-Ware 3.2 from non-bootable CD: <br />
Initialize a new VM-Ware config for Windows 2000 Professional via the configuration wizard. Point the CD-ROM device at its proper /dev location, but point the floppy at a file (e.g. /vmware/win2000Pro/floppy). VM-Ware will warn that this "device" doesn't exist. This is fine; continue anyway. Make sure the box is checked to enable (connect) the floppy at Power On. <br />
When the wizard is complete, select Settings -> Configuration Editor from VM-Ware's menu, and edit the Floppy Drives entry. Change the combo box from Device to File, and make sure that the path is the same as in (1). <br />
Mount your CD-ROM under Linux, and find cdboot1.img on the mounted file system. Copy cdboot1.img into the floppy's file (e.g. from (1) above). <br />
Power on VM-Ware. This should bring up the normal Windows 2000 Disk 1 installation screen. If not, make sure that: <br />
the Floppy configuration from Settings -> Configuration Editor points at the right file;<br />
that you've copied cdboot1.img into the file indicated below the combo box; and,<br />
that the floppy is connected at Power On (the corresponding check box should be darkened);<br />
When Windows 2000 Setup asks for a new Disk N, copy the corresponding cdbootN.img into the floppy file.<br />
That's it. Windows 2000 Setup should proceed as normal.<br />

<h5>Shivani Goodman's website</h5>

<i>Excerpt....</i><br />
<blockquote><br />
<br />
~SThe "THE FIVE MINUTE CANCER OR DISEASE CURE" Experienced and named by NY Times best selling Chicken-Soup series co-author Jack Canfield A physician from New York was diagnosed with colon cancer. I taught him an ancient Self-Healing Exercise that is in my book. The intention of that ancient method was to erase sickness and suffering from the planet.<br />
<br />
<br />
I spent five to ten minutes teaching it to him and directed him to practice it for 5 to 10 minutes three times per day. ~SI don~Rt believe in this staff~T he said. ~SYou don~Rt have to believe in it, it still works as long as you do it~T I responded. ~SBut I~Rm going for surgery next week~T he continued. ~SThat~Rs ok~T I reassured, ~Simagine that when the surgeons open you up, the tumor is gone.~T ~SThat~Rs impossible~T he responded laughing ~Sbut I have nothing to lose doing it, I~Rll do it.~T A week later he called saying that when the surgeons opened him up, to everyone~Rs amazement, the tumor was gone. Thousands of people worldwide have learned how to heal themselves with this exercise, including those challenging AIDS and other terminal diseases such as heart failure, hypertension, ulcers, arthritis, rheumatism, depression, anxiety, migraines, allergies, asthma, back pain, chronic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, phobias, agoraphobia, and so on.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Self-Healing Exercise: Breathe is love energy from the sun into your heart. Feel the love as fire in your heart and direct that energy of love into your left leg. Fill up the whole leg with this energy allowing the muscles to relax so that the love energy penetrates the billions of cells in that area. Do the same with the right leg, the left arm, right arm, lower body, upper body, neck and head.<br />
Now send extra dosages of energy to the area that you are healing, where you may have pain or discomfort. This is most important part of the exercise: in your mind~Rs eye, see that area already healed and perfect, shining and vibrating with health at the same time that you are sending healing love energy to that area. Imagine the billions of cells blossoming into smiling flowers.<br />
<br />
<br />
 According to quantum science, the observer changes what he observes with the conscious or subconscious intention. This principle applies here too. Do it three times a day for five to ten minutes, and a one-minute version whenever you remember. People have said: ~SI could feel my tumor shrinking, or my cold healing, as I imagined observing it healed, using my inner eye.~T<br />
 I took a vow in 1992, when I thought I was dying of cancer, that if I make it, I will devote my life to help erase sickness from the world. The above is a short version of the exercise that is in the new book "The Goodman Guide to Prevent or Reverse Cancer or Other Diseases - In as little as 30 minutes a day."<br />
<br />
<br />
If you pass this '5 Minute Cure' exercise on to 2 people you love, and they pass it on to two people theycare about, in thirty-three days, every human being can learn to heal themselves. Two to the power thirty-three is about 8.6 billion. There are less than 7 billion people on the planet. The more are healed, the better world we will all have, and the more we will be able to enjoy living our lives. Let me know how this exercise works for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don~Rt feel anything, that usually is, an indication that internal emotional<br />
issues are blocking that experience. In my book ~SThe Goodman Guide to Prevent or Reverse Cancer or Other Diseases, in as little as 30 minutes a day~T you can learn how to release these blocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Love and many blessings of joy ~V Shdema Goodman. Email: shdemag@aol.com<br />
<br />
<br />
My book may be downloaded from my website. Click on the ~Qfeel light~R browser on top left side of this page to receive love energy from Maui, HI. Yout feedback, acknowledgements or testimonials may be mentioned in this or the next book, if you wish.<br />
<br />
</blockquote>

Do what you Love.<br />
Live where you Love.<br />
Pray where you Love.

nethack patch ideas:

if you polymorph into a troll, you discover you were just "mostly dead" and<br />
not "all dead", and become alive again.

if you are a two-headed troll, you can wear two amulets.

trolls can wear amulets of life-saving

if a human is around, and if there is water around, and if you are polymorphed<br />
into a troll, the human will try to pick you up and throw you in the water, killing you permanently, just like a troll.

<br />
Miracle Max : He probably owes you money huh? I'll ask him. <br />
Inigo Montoya : He's dead. He can't talk. <br />
Miracle Max : Whoo-hoo-hoo, look who knows so much. It just so happens that your friend here is only MOSTLY dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there's usually only one thing you can do. <br />
Inigo Montoya : What's that? <br />
Miracle Max : Go through his clothes and look for loose change. <br />

Indeed, that's practically the definition of a nerd. I found myself talking recently to someone from Hollywood who was planning a show about nerds.

I found this syntax summary on the web in March 2001, but couldn't find it again now: ( in 2002, this summary has been added in the wiki: An Introduction to Tcl Scripting)<br />
<pre><br />
Script = commands separated by newlines or semicolons. <br />
Command = words separated by white space. <br />
$ causes variable substitution. <br />
[] causes command substitution. <br />
"" quotes white space and semi-colons. <br />
{} quotes all special characters. <br />
\ quotes next character, provides C-like substitution. <br />
# for comments (must be at beginning of command).<br />
</pre>
